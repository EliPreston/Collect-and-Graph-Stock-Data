# Collect-and-Graph-Stock-Data

A little stock data visualization project to see any differences in price behaviour over the holiday season. Using my API key from https://www.alphavantage.co/ I retrieve the data for a list of stock symbols/tickers and then graph the data using Matplotlib. I have also used simple-term-menu to make CLI interaction a little bit cleaner.
